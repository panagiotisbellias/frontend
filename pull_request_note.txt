Requirements
There are currently four supported methods for getting up and running with Instalution.

Method chosen: Option 1: Installing Instalution with pnpM
https://github.com/lipupini/frontend/blob/master/README-en.md#option-1-installing-instalution-with-pnpm

1. git clone https://github.com/instalution/frontend.git
2. cd frontend
3. pnpm install
4. pnpm next telemetry disable
5. Download an archive of your data from Instagram
6. Extract the contents of the media/posts/ directory in the archive to ./public/accounts/[archive_folder_name]. The base folder name will become the username, and Instalution will read every image and video in every subfolder.
7. 	pnpm add -D cross-env
		Updated package.json to "dev": "cross-env NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 next dev --port 1234"
		pnpm dev -- Instalution should now be available at http://localhost:1234
